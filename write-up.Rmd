# Simulation

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X &\sim \mathrm{Unif}\{-1, 1\} \\
    T &\sim S(t|X) = \exp\Big\{-\Big(\frac{t}{5}\Big)^{\exp(0.3X)}\Big\} \\
    C &= 10
\end{aligned}
$$
This particular scenario does not allow for expressing $S(t|x)$ using the standard Cox-PH model, which assumes that $S(t|x) = \exp(-H_0(t)\exp(\beta x))$, where the value of $\beta$ remains constant over time.
